## SSHiny

This is a work in progress, but will eventually be an SSH client and server.

You're looking at a code dump, there's nothing functional here, at the moment.

### Testing

Test a SSHiny client against a SSHiny server:

    node test.js

Test a SSHiny client with any SSH server:

    node testRemote.js <host> <port>
